# tigerCenter

Tiger Center is an alternative application that allows RIT students to search for classes, enroll in classes and view important academic information for active academic semesters. The main goal of the project is to modernize and extend the functionality of the current system. Tiger Center utilizes front-end frameworks, such as foundations and bootstrap to create a responsive mobile friendly design. SASS is used to extend CSS abilities and create a smoother experience for the user.
